### Working with Branches on this Repo
_____________

The permanant branches will be **production** and **staging**.  The team will create feature, bug fix, or other branches from the **staging** branch.

Pull Requests will be created to merge into the **staging** branch and as best practice, request a team member to review.  

Since this is the free tier, you can only use Github to request one review, but for more, just message everyone.
