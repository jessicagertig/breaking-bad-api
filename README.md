## Working with Branches on this Repo
_____________

The permanant branches will be **production** and **staging**.  The team will create feature, bug fix, or other branches from the **staging** branch.

### Pull Requests

Pull Requests will be created to merge into the **staging** branch and as best practice, request a team member to review.  

Since this is the free tier, you can only use Github to request one review, but for more, just message everyone on Slack.

Also, the free tier does not let you create Draft PRs, which are useful.  There is **wip** tag you can add to your PR in additon to putting *WIP* at the beginning of the name.

The purpose of such PRs is to allow the team to more easily review your code before you are *officially* "done" with the PR.
